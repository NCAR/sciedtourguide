  "content_cloud_title": "Clouds",
  "content_cloud_description": "<p>Clouds form when air rises from the Earth’s surface. As this air rises, it cools, water vapor condenses on tiny particles in the atmosphere, and forms clouds. Check out the touchscreen under the windows to learn more about clouds, and look outside to identify the clouds you can see in the sky. </p>",

  "audio_cloud_description": "What are clouds made of?",
  "audio_cloud_transcript": "That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. This painting comes right out of your heart. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. And just raise cain. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Let your heart be your guide. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Let's have a nice tree right here. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.",

The highest wind speed ever recorded here at the NCAR Mesa Lab was a 147 mph gust on January 23, 1971.</p>",

Microbursts are very dangerous for airplanes during takeoff or landing. To address this safety issue, in the 1980s NCAR scientists developed a microburst detection system that makes air travel much safer.</p>",
