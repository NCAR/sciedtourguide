Some plants are particularly sensitive to ozone and develop visible symptoms of ozone damage on their leaves that look like tiny spots. This makes them useful biological indicators of high and dangerous levels of ground-level ozone during the growing season."

Radio waves are beamed from one satellite to another and bend slightly as they pass through the atmosphere. Careful study of those radio waves reveals information about temperature, humidity, pressure, and other traits of the air at different heights and around the globe."
